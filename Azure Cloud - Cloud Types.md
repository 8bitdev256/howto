# Azure Cloud - Cloud Types

## Private Cloud

 - 100% On-Premise Environment. You have your architecture, servers, routers, firewall and others, but it is only for your company.

 - Organizations create a cloud environment in their datacenter.

 - Organizations are responsible to operate the services they provide.

 - Does not provide access to users outside the organization.

## Public Cloud

 - Delivery of services and resources to a range of customers through a single provider. Example: Azure.

## Hybrid Cloud

 - Assuming that your company already uses a private cloud, but you realize that it is too much work to create a data center, buy a server, and other resources needed to provide the cloud service, you decide to use a hybrid cloud. In this type of cloud, your company has both a private and a public cloud, and the two can communicate resources with each other.

 ## Multi Cloud

  - It is a type of cloud where your company has both private and public cloud types, but the public cloud types that the company uses are in more than one provider. Example: Azure and AWS.
