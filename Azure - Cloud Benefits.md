## High availability

Microsoft's Service Level Agreement states that a service may have a percentage of unavailability.

This downtime is already included in the contract, so it is an expected downtime and for us programmers, all we can do is wait for the service to become available.

Microsoft provides a website to check the availability of locations and services and notifies us of a deadline for correction and other such information.

If the downtime exceeds the contract limit, Microsoft will refund you as a credit.

## Scalability

 Refers to the ability to adjust resources (up or down) to meet demand.
 
 For example, you can increase the amount of server storage space if the demand for storage increases, or decrease it if the demand for storage decreases.

 In this case, we are referring to the vertical scale.

 ## Elasticity

 With elasticity, if you experienced a sudden sharp jump in demand, your deployed resources could be expanded (automatically or manually)
 
 For example, you can add virtual machines or containers by scaling out.

 Likewise, if there is a significant drop in demand, deployed resources can be scaled down (automatically or manually).
