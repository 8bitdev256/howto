## Azure - CapEx and OpEx

### CapEx (Capital expenditures)

 - The initial outlay of money on physical infrastructure: buy servers, network equipment, storage, among others;

 - CapEx expenses have a value that decreases over time: You invest in infrastructure, but your spending decreases after the investment, because after the investment, you will only pay for the resources to keep the infrastructure running.

### OpEx (Operating expenses)

 - Spend on products and services as needed, pay as you go

 - Get charged immediately
