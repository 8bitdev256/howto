# Azure - Cloud Model Comparison

## Public Cloud

 - No capital expenditure to scale vertically: You pay for what you use in specified period of time. Example: You pay for a server you used for 15 days

 - Applications can be provisioned and de-provisioned quickly. If you have chosen an incorrect configuration for storage, network, server, etc., this can be quickly undone

 - Organizations pay only for what they use

 - The responsibility for the hardware lies with the cloud service used (Azure, AWS, etc.)

 - Regarding security, the cloud service provides tools, but it is your responsibility to configure them to your needs

## Private Cloud

 - Organizations have full control and responsibility over resources and security

 - Organizations are responsible for hardware/software maintenance and upgrades

## Hybrid Cloud

 - Organizations determine where (on which country's server) to run their applications

 - Organizations control security, compliance, and legal requirements

 - Provides greater flexibility
